## Description: 

The purpose of this project is to provide useful information on the best county/regional investment in the United States to various stakeholders like individual buyers, national real estate developers, and financial institutions. Both individuals and institutions hope to invest in the real estate market with the best interest rate and minimal risk, and hope that it will be the best investment for the long term.
  
We will focus on two challenges: a) analyze the important influencing factors of real estate prices to answer the question “Where and When to Buy a House”; b)  predict the real estate price of a county in the next few months or years.
